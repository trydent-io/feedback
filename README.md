## Welcome to the official Feedback demo game page

Inspired by [Jonanthan Cooper](https://twitter.com/GameAnim)'s [article](http://www.gameanim.com/2005/06/15/flashback-a-study-in-standards/) and the disappointing [Flashback remake](http://store.steampowered.com/app/245730/Flashback/) released some time ago, I wanted to try to implement my own version of Dolphin Software game.
However time flies and a lot of things happened in between, so I just tried to develop a simple demo - named Feedback - by using [CreateJS](http://createjs.com/) and the Conrad-sprite from the Flashback MacOS version at least
(kindly provided me by [Gregory Montoir](https://github.com/cyxx) many thanks!).
      
## Repository
* Fork the [Feedback repo](https://github.com/trystick/feedback)
* Run `npm install`
* Then `npm run dev`
* Use <kbd>Right</kbd> and <kbd>Left</kbd> to move the sprite
* Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> to make it jump forward
* Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Down</kbd> or <kbd>Up</kbd> to make it go down/up

That's all.
